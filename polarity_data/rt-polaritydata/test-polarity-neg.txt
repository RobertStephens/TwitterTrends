heroes in a half-arsed shell .
it ain't easy being green, especially as the charmless cg stars of this lowest-common-denominator action-comedy .
when a film can waste a character actor as respected as Fichtner, you know there are bigger problems beyond a slightly hackneyed script .
an inert "cape fear" rehash that can't seem to choose its favorite contrivance .
not only did the "twist" they had been endlessly hyping come across as a limp afterthought, but the movie itself is a gruelingly unpleasant slog .
if there is any distinction that this may have, it might simply be that it is one of the worst theatrically released films of the year .
nasty, ugly, extremely dumb home-invasion stinker and meretricious junk .
almost as bad as that moment in cinematic history when the real buzz aldrin has a conversation with optimus prime .
